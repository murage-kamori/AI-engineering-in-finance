# Apple Stock Analysis

#Task
John is an investor with Apple stocks. Each Apple stock is currently valued at $135. He bought 20 stocks at $60 each, then acquired an additional 10 at $145 each. He sold 8 stocks at $120 each. Now, John is evaluating the financial merits of selling his remaining stocks and is curious about the potential tax implications.

Tasks:

 Calculate and display the total value of the current Apple stocks in John’s portfolio.
 Calculate and display the average purchase price of John’s Apple stocks.
 Calculate and display the potential total capital gain if John sells all his Apple stocks now.

John holds dual citizenship in France and Belgium. In France, the tax rate on capital gains is 30%. In Belgium, capital gains are tax-exempt up to $500, and a 40% tax rate applies beyond this threshold. Calculate and display the taxes John would incur on his capital gains in France and Belgium.

#Ideology
This project analyzes the financial performance of an John’s Apple stock portfolio. It calculates the current portfolio value, average purchase price, and potential capital gains based on historical transactions.

 Additionally, it evaluates the tax liabilities on capital gains under French and Belgian tax regulations. The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, providing a practical example of applying financial concepts and tax calculations programmatically.
