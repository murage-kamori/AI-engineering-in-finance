 I built a simple compound interest simulator. It calculates how long it takes for a 1000€ investment to reach 2000€ at various rates (2-8%).

This is foundational for AI applications in finance—like predictive modeling, optimization, or ML-based forecasting (e.g., using libraries like scikit-learn later). No AI yet, but it's the stepping stone: simulating scenarios with code!

Key Concepts: While/for loops for iteration, if/else for decisions.
